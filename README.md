# Unsupervised Learning: Association Rule Mining

This repository explores the implementation and analysis of **Association Rule Mining**, a fundamental unsupervised learning technique used to uncover interesting relationships, patterns, and correlations among large sets of items in transactional databases.

## 📌 Overview

Association Rule Mining helps identify frequently co-occurring items in large datasets, making it especially valuable in fields such as market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and inventory optimization. Algorithms such as **Apriori**, **Eclat**, and **FP-Growth** are used to generate frequent itemsets and derive association rules.
